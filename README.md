# NLP at SemEval-2019 Task6: Detecting Offensive language using Neural Networks
This is a repository containing models submitted as part of our participation in SemEval Task 6 OffensEval: Idenstifying and categorizing Offensive lnaguage in social media by SemEval 2019 by (Zampieri et al.,2019b)

# Models
1. TaskA.py: It is a classification model dealing with 2 classes.
2. TaskB.py: This model is utilizing both the word and pos features. POS Tag for all the sentences can be get by POS_tag.py in form of text file and then inserted at line . 
3. TaskC.py
4. POS_tag.py: This can be used to get the POS tag for all the sentences using nltk and the output text file can be inserted at line
